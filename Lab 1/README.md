<h2>Assignment Description</h2>

In this laboratory, we are going to maintain a username-password system by storing the usernames and passwords in a file. The file will consist of a single username and password per line with a space in between.

<h2>Process</h2>

1. Begin by creating a class PasswordFile. 
  - The constructor accepts a filename, and reads the file one line at a time and adds values to the vectors user and password.
  - The function addpw adds a user/password pair to the end of each vector.
2. Create a password.txt file with some entries such as:
  - jsmith turtle
  - madams apple
3. Create a main program to test your classes.
